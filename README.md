Objective:
Design a solution to rank the pair(s) using any desired Indicator.
Stack ranking will be based on the maximum cumulative profit generated over a defined period (provided in input data).
The solution needs to provide following outcomes -
1. Find pairs of instruments that gives leading correlation to generate maximum profit based on the chosen model and prepare a report that explains the model used to generate the desired outcome.
2. The report should explain the features along with their rationale, scoring & weighing technique.
3. Make use of the best software design methodologies with a working front-end to display the output.
