Pair trading is basically a strategy in which we can bet on pairs of stocks which will diverge or converge in price. The price of the two stocks needs to be similar or at least close to one another. But at times when there is divergence or convergence in these prices, the trader can decide to go long or short on one of the stocks. There are many other indicators or factors that affect the choice of this pair of stocks.

The problem to be solved here is to generate a stack rank which basically ranks all the pairs based on the profit that can be obtained from them. The highest rank will have to be the pair that is highly correlated and thus can yield maximum profit.

We have to create an efficient model with an UI that can help us generate this stack rank. The model has to be created using the provided dataset. The dataset of the stocks contains the name of the company, date and close price of the stock which helps to identify which strategy should be used to obtain maximum profit in pair stocks. Indicators identify the performance of the stock in the market which helps to gain as maximum profit as possible. But there are numerous indicators which are used to analyse the performance of stock in the market, so which indicator should be used to gain maximum profit is decided according to the current market conditions. So we have to implement a model which will give a pair of instruments that gives leading correlation to maximise profit.
